				<p class="content">
					Natural food has a lifetime. Cooked and perishable food items such as bread, milk have considerably short life span. Even though other food items may have longer life span, but eventually all start decomposing.<br><br>
Once food has been harvested, gathered or slaughtered it begins to deteriorate until eventually it becomes unfit for consumption. This deterioration is known as decay and leads to food spoilage. Consumption of spoiled food may cause food poisoning, early detection can also help in food wastage.

				Having faced similar problems myself and my flatmates, I found a lot of people around me who would face difficulty in tracking food health and consuming it before it might become stale. This device would not only help them in letting a user know whats the current status of the food but can also notify user by when he should finish the food. However, learning when to consume food will come with machine learning but detecting if food is stale or not can be easily tackled using appropriate sensors.<br><br><br>Since this is more of a global problem following are few products which try to solve it in their own way:

				Developing a product which will let the user know the age of the food and also send reminders when the food is getting wasted/spoiled.<br><br> Brainstorming and secondary user research was done in order to understand how a user or system will identify stale food. It gave us an touchpoints which we will later use during ideating concepts.

			<span class="heading main">Concept 1</span>
			<p class="full-content">Ring to record the age of the food & remind the user about stored food. Ring starts the counter as soon as someone places utensil on it. It notifies the user after a threshold time in case the food is unused. Thus reminding the user to consume it or throw it based on the age of the food.<br><br>
Assumption : User can judge the condition of the food based on its age.
</p>
			<img class="hero" src="images/food/shape1.jpg" alt="shape" /><br><br>
			<span class="heading" style="padding-top:40px;">Problems Identified</span>
			<ul class="fbList">
				<li>The product is efficient in determining the age of the food only if the utensil is left untouched. In case where user lifts the utensil and places it again the time tracker resets itself and treats it as new container.</li>
				<li>This product can’t determine if the food item is stale or not. It can just help the user to let him know the exact age of the food item and remind him before the food reaches certain age limit.</li>
				<li>The product has no ability to differentiate between different weather conditions and adjust it’s threshold.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="full-content">
In the end, this product in itself is not efficient in solving the problem due to many limitations in determining the spoilage of food.

		<div class="section" id="concept-2">
			<span class="heading main">Concept 2</span>
			<p class="full-content">Using gas sensors that can detect spoilage of the food by detecting Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulphide. On spoilage of the food the light indicator changes to indicate that food is spoiled. Along with the light indicator a message to user is also sent on the status of the food. This is portable device and can be used with any kind of container.<br><br><br><br>

			<img class="hero" src="images/food/shape3.jpg" alt="shape" /><br>
			
			<span class="heading" style="padding-top:40px;">Problems Identified with Initial explorations (inside the lid stick ons)</span>
			<ul class="fbList">
				<li>This product has poor indication of the status of the food.
The status of food can be seen only on phone.</li>
<li>Users would prefer to have see the status of the food on the equipment over their mobile phone.</li>
<li>Since this concept depends on vacuum and glue stickers (which wear out really fast) it has short lifespan. Replacing these stickers again and again is not a good user experience.</li>
<li>The only advantage this design had is it would be really useful for someone who is travelling and using a packed container.
</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="heading" style="padding-top:40px;">Problems Identified with Final Concept</span>
			<ul class="fbList">
				<li>User couldn’t use this shape of the product along with the cover plate of the utensil.</li>
<li>It failed to fit into smaller utensils.</li>
<li>Even in case of without cover plate, it is difficult for the sensor to detect stale food gases properly and there’s a probability of wrong information provided to the user.

			<span class="heading main">Final Product</span>
			<p class="full-content">For final concept we stuck with gas sensors that can detect spoilage of the food by detecting Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulphide. On spoilage of the food the light indicator changes to indicate that food is spoiled. Along with the light indicator a message to user is also sent on the status of the food. This is portable device and can be used with any kind of container.<br><br>

			<img class="hero" src="images/food/usercase.jpg" alt="shape" style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;" /><br><br>
			<span class="heading" style="padding-top:40px;">Problems solved by this product</span>
			<ul class="fbList">
				<li>This product solves the problem of inaccurate, unreliable information on status of the food. Since the sensor is inside the covered utensil, it will provide accurate status of the food.</li>
<li>Light indicator/signifier to convey the status of the food are very well visible in this product.</li>
<li>With Wi-Fi connectivity enabled in the device a message about food getting wasted is also sent to the user.</li>
<li>Also the shape of this product allows it to be used with any kind of utensil, since it is attached to the cover plate and not the storage container. (Assuming that most of the stored food are always covered)</li>
<li>Shape of the product also makes it intuitive as to how to use it. As the clip can’t be used other way round, because of the curved shape on one side. The curved shape side would avoid the user from covering the utensil properly.</li>
<li>Also, the LED light indicator is visible only if used correctly otherwise the indicator would be hidden.
